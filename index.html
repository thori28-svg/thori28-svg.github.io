<p>
    Bruno is a very unique French bulldog on many levels. Starting with his coloration,
    his fur is a mix of dark and light greys, tan, and white, making him stand out from
    the frenchie masses. However, not only are his visuals striking, but his personality
    is also quite impressionable. Frenchies are often classified as "lap dogs," however Bruno
    lives life in sports mode. He is always down for an adventure or endless play time as he has
    a wide array of both hobbies and skills. Keep scrolling to explore them!
